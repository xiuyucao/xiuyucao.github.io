I am currently pursuing a Master's degree in [Geospatial Data Sciences](https://seas.umich.edu/academics/master-science/geospatial-data-sciences) at [University of Michigan](https://umich.edu). My current thesis project is about validating a biomass product from terraPulse using US Forest Inventory and Analysis data.

My research interests include utilizing remote sensing data to study and resolve environmental and ecology questions, especially those related to forests. I am currently doing a Master's thesis regarding validating the terraPulse AGB product (derived from GEDI AGB) using the US Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) field data.

Before coming to the University of Michigan, I got my bachelorâ€™s degree in Geomatics and Geodesy from [Wuhan University](https://en.whu.edu.cn). My thesis focused on using the GNSS-IR technique to monitor sea surface changes under extreme weather conditions.
