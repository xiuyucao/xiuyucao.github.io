I am currently pursuing a Master's degree in [Geospatial Data Sciences](https://seas.umich.edu/academics/master-science/geospatial-data-sciences) at [University of Michigan](https://umich.edu). My research interests include utilizing remote sensing data to study and resolve environmental and ecology questions, especially those related to forests. My current thesis project is about validating a biomass product from [terraPulse](https://www.terrapulse.com) using field measurements and estimates from [US Forest Inventory and Analysis](https://research.fs.usda.gov/programs/fia).

Before coming to the University of Michigan, I got my bachelorâ€™s degree in Geomatics and Geodesy from [Wuhan University](https://en.whu.edu.cn). My thesis focused on using the GNSS-IR technique to monitor sea surface changes under extreme weather conditions.
