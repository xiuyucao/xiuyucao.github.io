(Website under development)

My name is Xiuyu Cao, and I am currently pursuing a Master's degree in [Geospatial Data Sciences](https://seas.umich.edu/academics/master-science/geospatial-data-sciences) at [University of Michigan](https://umich.edu).

My research interests include utilizing remote sensing data to study and resolve environmental and ecology questions, especially those related to forests. I am currently doing a Master's thesis regarding validating the terraPulse AGB product (derived from GEDI AGB) using the US Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) field data.
